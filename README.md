# Rezet

Developed an app/website which can detect lifestyle diseases of an individual. The app takes input of an individual's daily intake, intoxicant use, past use of drugs etc and calculates the risk of lifestyle diseases. Our catalog of data corresponding to each lifestyle disease is checked and a disease is inferred. The remedies and physicians to be consulted so as to reduce the impact of these diseases or even cure the individual completely are available via the app/website. An overall information about medical help around the individual is made available for ease of access of services to the user.
	Early warning of probable cases of lifestyle diseases is made available through our product. Lifestyle-related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular, kidney, and chronic respiratory diseases form the leading causes of death, accounting for 71% of global mortality in 2016.
	Through our product, Users are able to detect early signs of lifestyle diseases and for those who are already diagnosed with lifestyle diseases are able to find ways of reducing the impacts via changing their diet, exercises, taking meds etc
